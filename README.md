Connect your WordPress site to DreamHost's DreamObjects.

## Description ##

This is the GitHome of DreamObjects, and is where I do the dev work. Betas are pushed here as soon as they work, and when there's 'enough' to push a new version, it goes to WordPress Plugins SVN.

## 19 March 2013 ##

Currently we're on version 3.2 

<em>What's New...</em>

PHP 5.4 support!

<em>Remaining Issues...</em>

1) When people use WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL in their wp-config, it doesn't always work. I don't know why.

2) Larger sites (500+megs) on a shared server don't always get backed up.
