Connect your WordPress site to DreamHost's DreamObjects

== Description ==

DreamHost has its own Cloud - <a href="http://dreamhost.com/cloud/dreamobjects/">DreamObjects</a>.

DreamObjectsâ„¢ is an inexpensive, scalable object storage service that was developed from the ground up to provide a reliable, flexible cloud storage solution for entrepreneurs and developers. It provides a perfect, scalable storage solution for your WordPress site.

= Backup Features =
* Automatically backs up your site (DB and files) to your DreamObjects cloud on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule.
* Retains 15, 30, 60, or 90 backups at any given time (so as not to charge you the moon when you have a large site).
* Provides <a href="https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli#what-is-wp-cli">wp-cli</a> hooks to do the same

= Uploader =
* Allows you to upload files to any bucket
* Determine if files are public (default) or private

= To Do =

== Frequently asked questions ==

= What does it do? =

DreamObjects connects your WordPress site to your DreamObjects cloud storage, allowing you to upload files directly to your cloud, or automatically store backups.

= Do I have to use DreamHost? =

Yes and no. You have to use Dream<em>Objects</em>, which belongs to Dream<em>Host</em>. This plugin was built on and specifically for DreamHost servers, so there's no assurance it'll work on other hosts.

= Can I use this on a Windows Server? =

You can try, and let me know how it goes. I built this for DreamHost, so it has only been tested on Linux boxes.

= How often can I schedule backups? =

You can schedule them daily, weekly, or monthly.

= Can I force a backup to run now? =

Yep! It actually sets it to run in 60 seconds, but works out the same.

= How long does it keep backups for? =

Since you get charged on space used for DreamObjects, the default is to retain the last 15 backups. If you need more, you can save up to 90 backups, however that's rarely needed.

= Can I keep them forever? =

If you chose 'all' then yes, however this is not recommended. DreamObjects (like most S3/cloud platforms) charges you based on space and bandwidth, so if you have a large amount of files stored, you will be charged more money.

= Who can upload files? =

Anyone who can upload media can upload files, so this generally covers Authors and up. Only the Administrators can set the upload bucket, however.

= How do I use the CLI? =
If you have <a href="https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli#what-is-wp-cli">wp-cli</a> installed on your server (which DreamHost servers do), you can use the following commands:

<pre>wp dreamobjects backup</pre>

= Do you work for DreamHost? =

Yes, but this isn't an official DreamHost plugin at this time. It just works.
