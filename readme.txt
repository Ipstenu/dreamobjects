== Frequently asked questions ==

= What does it do? =

DreamObjects allows you to store your data securely, redundantly and inexpensively. The backup portion of this plugin will create a backup of your site, zip it, and toss it up into your DreamObjects bucket in an automated manner.

= Do I have to use DreamHost? =

Yes and no. You have to use Dream<em>Objects</em>, which belongs to Dream<em>Host</em>. This plugin was built on and specifically for DreamHost servers, so there's no assurance it'll work on other hosts.

= How often can I schedule backups? =

You can schedule them daily, weekly, or monthly.

= Can I force a backup to run now? =

Yep! It actually sets it to run in 60 seconds, but works out the same.

= How do I use the CLI? =
If you have <a href="https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli#what-is-wp-cli">wp-cli</a> installed on your server (which DreamHost servers do), you can use the following commands:

<pre>wp dreamobjects backup</pre>

While the schedule option shows, it doesn't fully work yet. Sorry.

= Do you work for DreamHost? =

Yes, but this isn't an official DreamHost plugin at this time. It just works.
